# Available demos for RH Process Automation Manager

## Optiplanner Vehicle Routing

### About
OptaPlanner "OptaWeb VRP Demo" on the Red Hat Product Demo System (RHPDS). OptaWeb VRP allows you to demonstrate the OptaPlanner's solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem, in a modern web-based application running on OpenShift.

The demo demonstrates the routing of vehicles between ATMs in Boston Massachusetts. It allows users to add new locations to the data-set by simply clicking on a map. Updates of routes of the vehicles is down "live" when OptaPlanner finds new better solutions to the problem.

### Demo resources

RHPDS can be accessed at https://rhpds.redhat.com. The demo can be found under: "Catalog -> Middleware Solution Demos -> DM7 OptaWeb VRP Demo".

The source code of the demo can be found here: https://github.com/kiegroup/optaweb-vehicle-routing 

#### Points of Contact

Jiri Locker, who has built most the demo, and Geoffrey de Smet. As always, I simply used a bit of pixie dust to get it t run on OpenShift in RHPDS.
